Project: Technoecom E-Commerce Analytics (EDA & CXO Reporting)
Engineer building deployable AI systems

Designed and executed a full EDA workflow for a fictional e-commerce platform (Technoecom), analysing revenue by warehouse, seasonality, and coupon impact using Python, pandas, and seaborn.

Produced a CXO-ready HTML/PDF report that translated analytical findings into concrete decisions for warehouse investment and digital expansion.

Structured the notebook and exports to be rerunnable as new data arrives, forming the analytics foundation for future predictive models.
