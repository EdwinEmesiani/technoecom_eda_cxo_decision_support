# Contributing to Technoecom E-Commerce EDA – CXO Decision Support

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing 🙌  
This project is part of a broader portfolio focused on **building deployable AI systems**, with Technoecom providing the **analytics & decision-support foundation**.

The goal of this repo is to maintain a **clean, reproducible, business-facing EDA** that CXO-level stakeholders can trust and use.

## 🧭 Project Scope

This repository focuses on:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Technoecom’s e-commerce data  
- Business-question–driven analytics (warehouses, seasonality, coupons, satisfaction)  
- CXO-ready narrative outputs (notebooks, HTML/PDF reports)  

This is **not** a model zoo or a general-purpose ML playground.  
Any modelling work should **support** the core business questions, not dilute the EDA focus.
